# Poll website

A polling website where an user can create as many polls as he wants with as many questions as he wants . Made with rails 7 and ruby 3.1.3.

Each user can vote only 1 time per poll. 
Every poll can be edited by the user that created it and even questions that were voted on can be deleted.

Each poll votes are tracked and I used chartkick to add an pie chart to represent the votings in each poll.
Used devise for user authentication and bootstrap for CSS styling.
